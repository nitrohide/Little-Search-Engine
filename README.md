# Little-Search-Engine
Uses hash tables and array lists to parse through text files and return the files with the most relevance/occurrences of the keyword.

In addition, noise words and all punctuations are filtered out from being hashed in order to increase the accuracy of the search. I implemented LittleSearchEngine.java.
